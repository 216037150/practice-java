Java was made in 1995 by Sun MicroSystem, and lead by the team of James Gosling
It is updated every six months
Java is platform independent, because of JVM
JVM is platform dependent
JVM only understand bytecode
Java Code(Human language) --> compiler(Javac)-->Bytecode-->JVM
At least one class must have one main as an entry point.
it must have this method: public static void main (String[] args) : this is the signature
Java is static type: meaning it concerned about the data types


Java is Object Oriented, meaning we must have class and object
As a developers, we install JDK, and JDK contain JRE, and JRE contains JVM
Variable: Imagine variable is a box, you want to store some thing, then what type of this something


Data Types

Baby Shark Can Interpret Long Fish Dream Better (Use this to master Type Casting)

Baby → byte

shark → short

Can → char

Interpret → int

Long → long

Fish → float

Dream → double

Better -> Boolean

Primitive data types:   1. Integer: int, byte, short, long
                        2. Float: float, double
                        3 Character: 'c'
                        4. Boolean: True or false

int num = 7;
int result = ++num // Increment and then fetch the value       (pre - increment)
int result = num++ // fetch the value and the increment        (post - increment)


Relational operators: <, >, >=, <=, True or false, ==, !=
Logical Operators: AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)
Truth Table
Ternary Oparator:   result = n%2 == 0 ? "Even": "Odd"      ======> System.out.println(result);

Switch statement: Switch( condition){ Case 1:
                            sout();
                            break;
                            Case 2
                            ...
                            default:
                            sout()
                            }
}

Loops:  for loop        : Used when the number of iterations is known. It runs a specific number of times.
        while loop      : Runs as long as the given condition is true. The condition is checked before each iteration.
        do while loop   : Similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the loop body executes.

Object Oriented Programming
Who create object in Java: JVM
Object : Properties and behaviour


Data Areas
Memories : We have Stack and Heap
Every method has got own its Stack.
Main Method ==
Stack has got key and value
If we dont have the add method on main, then it will create a new Stack
Local Variables are part of the stack
Instance Variable are part of the Heap Memory
obj + are save on main memory
The is a link between Stack and Heap

Arrays
use the [] to declare array
It store values of the same data type
It have the fixed size     ====> int num[] = new int[5] ===> By default all the values in int array are zero
It can be accessed using indexes: index start at zero
They are fast
we   can use nums.length as a variable

Exception are run time errors

String
+ it used to concatinate strings
length
Strings are immutable by defaults

String buffer =======>
String builder ====>

Static Key words:
Static variable is shared by all the object
